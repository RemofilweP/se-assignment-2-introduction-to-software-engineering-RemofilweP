# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

1. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
- The techniques and systematic methods used to develop large software systems to solve organisational problems and constraints (Van Vliet et al., 2008). Software engineers are invlolved in the conceptualisation and creation of a solutions as well as post deployment maintenance, they are the architects of the software worls while programmers are more involved with the software programmer will use these guidelines to write lines of code to solve the problem. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

2. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
- A software development methodology, also known as SDLC, is a framework used in various engineering and industrial fields like systems engineering, software engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, computational sciences, and applied engineering (Bassil, 2012). 
-- Agile: The Vision Phase: Existing problem analysis and  and establishing the scope and boundary conditions of the proposed system. The main objective is to identify critical uses, uncertainty level, and overall system size and duration; The Exploration Phase: An iterative process to reduce uncertainty in requirements through continuous meetings with stakeholders, workshops, and brainstorming; The Iteration Planning Phase: It involves software development activities such as reviewing the last iteration's working software, assessing progress, and discussing future plans. Iteration planning prioritizes requirements based on value, knowledge, and financial returns, aiming to increase ROI and produce working software in a shorter time; The ADCT Phase:  An iterative process involving Analysis, Design, Coding, and Testing (ADCT). It involves several iterations to enhance the system's functionality. The first iteration builds the system's architecture, followed by designing, coding, and testing. The final iteration is when the product is ready for deployment; The Release Phase: It is divided into two sub-phases: pre-release and production. Pre-release involves testing and ensuring system functionality, while production involves releasing the product for customer use. The team handles two responsibilities after the first release: enhancing product functionality and providing customer help.
-- Waterfall: It typically has five phases:- The Analysis Phase: Involves system and business analysts defining both functional and non-functional requirements for a software. Functional requirements describe use cases, while non-functional requirements focus on criteria, constraints, limitations, and requirements for software design and operation; The Design Phase: Involves software developers and designers defining a software solution's plan, including algorithm design, software architecture, database schema, concept design, graphical user interface design, and data structure definition; The Implementation Phase: Involves converting business requirements and design specifications into a tangible executable program, database, website, or software component through programming and deployment, transforming the requirements into a production environment; The Testing phase: It involves evaluating software to ensure it meets initial requirements and fulfills its intended purpose. It also includes debugging to identify and correct bugs and system glitches; The Maintenance Phase: Involves modifying a software solution post-delivery to improve performance, correct errors, and adapt to new user requirements, enhancing software reliability.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

3. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
-  Agile is characterized by its flexibility, iterative process, and high customer involvement, making it suitable for dynamic environments where requirements change frequently.  It consists of phases such as Vision, Exploration, Iteration Planning, ADCT (Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing), and Release, emphasizing continuous stakeholder engagement and incremental enhancements. In contrast, the Waterfall model is rigid and sequential, with clearly defined stages: Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance. It is best suited for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, often found in regulated industries or large-scale projects with complex interdependencies. Agile excels in projects requiring rapid development and frequent reassessment, while Waterfall is ideal for projects where upfront planning and documentation are critical.

Requirements Engineering:

4. What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
- Requirements engineering (RE) is the initial phase of the software life cycle, where functional and nonfunctional requirements are elicited and documented in a requirements specification, which can be system requirements or software requirements specification.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
